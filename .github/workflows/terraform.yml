# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Terraform

# Controls when the workflow will run

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

      # Step 3: Initialize a new or existing Terraform working directory

        run: terraform init

      # Step 4: Checks that all Terraform configuration files are syntactically valid
      - name: Terraform Validate
        run: terraform validate
